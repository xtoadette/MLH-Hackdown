# MLH-Hackdown
TCNJ HackDown 2022 Best Overall Hack

Our group: The Scrapers (Stephanie, Spandana, Stenneth and Haemah) created Covid-19 In A Nutshell. 
This project was directed by Stephanie with the help of her team members.
They were able to scrape and create a website which would inform the audience with information of the coronavirus pandemic in terms of its environmental impact, case numbers, and social impact. 
Information was gathered using web scraping.
Python libraries used include requests, beautiful soup, and flask.
All information is displayed in HTML and formatted in CSS.
The purpose of this project is to have one website where the impact of an event is broken down into the simplest way possible.
We believe that this idea of "In a Nutshell" websites would be helpful for the public to understand major events.
